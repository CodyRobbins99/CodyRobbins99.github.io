# Cody's Portfolio V 1.0

A personalized portfolio is a must for every aspiring web developer trying to find their footing
in the professional industry, so this week I set out to create the first version of my own portfolio
page.

This portfolio website is optimized for the average desktop, smaller desktop screens with a max width
of 980px, tablet screens with a max width of 768px, and phone screens with a max width of 575px.
